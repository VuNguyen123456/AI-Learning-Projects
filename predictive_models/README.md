# Predictive Modeling: Decision Trees and Neural Networks

This project explores predictive modeling using a synthetic decision-making
dataset inspired by a restaurant waiting scenario.

Two different learning paradigms are implemented and compared.

---

## Data Generation
- A synthetic dataset of 100 examples
- Binary classification: wait or not wait
- Balanced class distribution
- Rule-based labeling logic

---

## Models Implemented

### Decision Tree
- Custom implementation of a decision tree learning algorithm
- Symbolic, rule-based classification

### Neural Network
- Simple feedforward neural network
- Boolean or one-hot encoded features
- Probabilistic output with threshold-based classification

---

## Evaluation
Both models are evaluated on held-out test data using accuracy as the primary
metric. Experiments are repeated with varying training set sizes to observe how
data availability affects performance.

---

## Focus
- Comparing symbolic AI vs neural approaches
- Understanding model behavior with limited data
- Evaluating generalization performance
