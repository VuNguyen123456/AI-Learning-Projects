# Adversarial Search with Minimax and A*

This project models a two-player adversarial game played on a directed, weighted
graph. Two agents, MAX and MIN, take turns moving along edges until a goal node
is reached.

MAX seeks to maximize total path cost, while MIN seeks to minimize it.

## Key Concepts
- Adversarial search
- Minimax algorithm
- A* search with admissible heuristics
- Reverse A* strategy
- Game tree modeling

---

## Algorithms Implemented
- Minimax search over a game tree
- A* search for cost minimization (MIN player)
- Reverse A* strategy for cost maximization (MAX player)

---

## Strategy Comparison
Multiple graph scenarios are used to compare:
- Standard minimax outcomes
- A*-guided decision-making
- Reverse A* behavior for adversarial maximization

These comparisons demonstrate how heuristic-guided strategies influence game
outcomes.

---

## Focus
This project emphasizes reasoning about optimal play, heuristic design, and the
interaction between adversarial decision-making and search algorithms.
