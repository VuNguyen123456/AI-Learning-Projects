# AI Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of Python projects focused on core
Artificial Intelligence concepts, including search, game playing, constraint
satisfaction, probabilistic reasoning, and machine learning models.

Each project is self-contained and emphasizes understanding the underlying
algorithms rather than relying on high-level libraries.

The projects were developed as part of structured AI coursework and independent
study.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Iterative Deepening Search on Graphs
Implements an iterative deepening search algorithm that safely handles graph
cycles and searches for goal states defined by numeric properties.

### 2. Adversarial Search with Minimax and A*
Models a two-player adversarial pathfinding game using minimax, A*, and reverse
A* strategies.

### 3. Constraint Satisfaction & Bayesian Networks
Solves a map-coloring problem using CSP techniques and probabilistic reasoning
with Bayesian Networks.

### 4. Predictive Modeling: Decision Trees & Neural Networks
Builds and evaluates predictive models for a synthetic decision-making problem,
comparing symbolic and neural approaches.
